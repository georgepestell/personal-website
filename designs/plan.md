# Aims
I want this site to be able to show what I'm currently working on (see Thomas
Frank's /now page idea). I want there to be somewhere I can just put my ideas
about things in a public place, with pictures along the way.

I want my socials to be visible, including my EMail address somewhere, just so
people can get in touch with me if they want. I want to have my CV somewhere on
there but I might do it as a page which you can export rather than having a link
like last time.
