I don't mean the set and forget new years resolutions many of us have made in the past. I mean planned targets with a roadmap at least thought out, so hopefully I can actually complete some of them. One of the early goals I came up with is to run an ultra marathon. </p>\n<p>Having run for a few years, I try to get out and run 3 times a week - slowly increasing my average pace and distance. It feels quite repetetive running without a particular event to train for so, I looked at a few local options. Around where I live there's a route standing out to me. Not a formal race with a medal or belt buckle for finishing. Just a humble set of sign posts around hampshire. This route is called The Strawberry Trail.</p>\n<center>\n<p><img src=\"./strawberry-trail.png\" alt=\"The Strawberry Trail Route\"></p>\n</center>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/routes/23296093\"><strong><em>The Strawberry Trail</em></strong></a> is a <strong>28 mile</strong> figure of 8 route centering around manor farm. Passing through fields, by landmarks and around areas heavily involved in the strawberry industry of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Here I have the opportunity to explore my own local history which is not really something myself or many of the people I know have done much of. It's really easy to forget that the way people live their lives is, in many ways, miles apart from how they were in relatively recent history and it feels like the ways people made the most of their lives may be able to lend wisdom to how we can find a sense of meaning in our own, despite these lifestyle changes.</p>\n<p>From the mid 19th century, it looks like Hedge End and the surrounding area supported a booming strawberry industry. Railway stations were constructed for the sole purpose of transporting vast quantities of the fruit across the country. The short shelf-life item demanded an efficient train system as demand was high. With over-seas imports not viable because transport times were too long without refridgeration. This lead to train stations getting built and platforms getting extended with the main aim of getting more strawberries out more efficiently.</p>\n<p>This boom lasted and proceeded for over a century but (in the 1960's), as with many fruits and vegetables and as technology caught up, international imports opened up a global marketplace and tough competition. This ultimately was impossible to overcome and still be profitable enough for the industry to survive. Thus, the old strawberry fields turned to housing and people moved on.</p>\n<p>So, when? <strong>May 16<sup>th</sup></strong> is probably the best time for it. The temperature is cool enough not to die of dehydration but the weather tends to be clearer than not. Also It gives me the time to get used to the longer distances and running with bottles of water. </p>\n<p>Having run a small portion of the route hundreds of times. This route feels almost like a worm-hole to another time. A glimpse of what was to be found through the same ground farmers walked and strawberries grew. I recommend people look for these signs around where they live. In the UK there are many of these sign-posts with the trail names on them and maybe you too can find some history hidden right infront of you.</p>\n<p>If you are <strong>that</strong> interested, you can follow my runs throughout the year: <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/19562536\"><span class='button-strava'>Follow Me On Strava</span></a> and <a href=\"/feed.xml\">subscribe to my rss feed</a> as I think I might make some more posts about it as I progress.</p>\n<p>You can also track my goals for the year <a href=\"\">here</a></p>","id":"78daec62-04d4-581a-a81b-63ec199859b1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":3,"skip":3,"currentPage":2,"numOfPages":2}}}
