I've always been short), I have\nbecome more and more aware of the feeling of brain fog. What I used to just\nthink was a lack of sleep is actually far more complex, yet useful for gauging\nthe benefit of different lifestyle choices.</p>\n<p>It was this goal for findingconsistency and mentally clarity that lead me to\nfinding 30 day challenges. Introduced to me through a video by freelance\nfilm-maker/YouTuber <a href=\"https://youtube.com/user/blackboxfilmcompany\">Matt\nD'Avella</a>. Usually from the\nbeginning of each month, and for 30 days, you chose 1 activity or change to\ncommit to and just focus on that one thing to add to your life. I found that\nthis made trying new things more interesting and stopped me over-loading myself\nwhen I feel like I am not good enough. Real change comes from slowing down and\nmaking small, compound changes, which overall lead to bigger changes as you\ngrow.</p>\n<p><em>Just to note this obviously isn't advice. More so, this is just my\nexperience in trying to make my life better and you shouldn't really be\nlistening to me anyway.</em></p>\n<p>With that said: What is brain fog? In my experience, brain fog is pretty self explanatory.\nThoughts feel slow and uninspired, and despite efforts to rouse; the task of\nconcentrating seems near impossible without a Finnish ice bath to shock the\nnervous system awake. All round it just feels bad.</p>\n<p>I don't know the best way to tackle this phenomena. I have found real tangible\nresults with getting at least 7 hours sleep every night and with getting to\nsleep at as consistent a time as I can maintain. Also with creating an exercise\nschedule and keeping to it. Overall I think the key is just in consistency. We\nadapt to what we experience on a regular basis. Obviously, continuously treating\nyourself with no respect won't get you anywhere but by making decisions just to\n'quit' after a few weeks of 'giving up on sugar' and binging is more\ncounter-productive than gradually reducing sugar when you can at your own pace.</p>\n<p>I've come to realize I don't need to be who I want to be at this very second.\nIn-fact, the goal posts are always moving because getting everything you want would make\neverything instantly lose all meaning. Therefore, you naturally aim higher as\nyou improve so chasing the target will only lead to the feeling of\ndisappointment. Aiming and letting yourself get there at the pace it\ntakes is all you can really do whilst celebrating the small victories along the\nway.</p>\n<p>I'll keep trying 30 day challenges when I can. This month (Feb 2020) i'm trying\nto get into writing and so have written for at least half an hour every day. I\nmight put a section up on the projects page about my past, present and future\n30 day challenges when I can be bothered ;)</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/brain-fog","title":"Brain Fog","date":"February 07, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
